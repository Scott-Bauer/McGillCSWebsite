first command:

django-admin startproject mysite

after this I create the app "cs" which is where our actual
html, JS, css will live. 

notice the subdirectories within cs such as static 
and templates. templates contains the html and
static has the css 

then the main thing is the urls.py file in "mysite" and how
it relates to the urls.py file in "cs", and that the urls.py
file in "cs" calls the functions in views.py to render each html/css/JS 
webpage
